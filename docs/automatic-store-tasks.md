# Automatic Store Platform Tasks

This document outlines a basic plan for building a platform that automatically manages products for a self‑hosted store. The platform can be extended to schedule tasks, create agents, and handle routine operations.

## Core Features
1. **Inventory Management** – Add, update, and remove products from a persistent data store.
2. **Task Automation** – Schedule background jobs to sync product data, adjust pricing, or publish inventory updates.
3. **Agent System** – Create modular agents responsible for tasks such as scraping supplier feeds or processing orders.
4. **Reporting** – Generate sales and inventory reports to identify profitable items.

## Recommended Development Tasks
1. **Implement a lightweight API** for product management using a framework like Flask or FastAPI.
2. **Set up a job scheduler** (e.g., Celery or APScheduler) to run recurring tasks.
3. **Integrate store APIs** so agents can push updates directly to the self‑hosted store backend.
4. **Persist data** in a database or a JSON file (as shown in `src/store_manager.py`).
5. **Write tests** for each component to ensure reliability as the platform grows.

This repository now includes a simple `Store` class and CLI (`src/store_manager.py`) to demonstrate basic inventory management. Extend it to fit your specific store and automation requirements.
