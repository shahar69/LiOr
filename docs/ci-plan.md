# CI/CD Plan

This document outlines the proposed CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Continuous Integration

### Triggers
- Pull requests and pushes to `main` or feature branches.

### Steps
1. **Checkout** the repository using `actions/checkout`.
2. **Set up dependencies** (e.g., install Python or Node versions).
3. **Install project dependencies** (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `npm ci`).
4. **Run linters** to enforce code style (e.g., `flake8`, `eslint`).
5. **Execute tests** with coverage (e.g., `pytest --cov` or `npm test`).
6. **Upload test artifacts** or coverage reports if required.

## Continuous Deployment / Release

### Triggers
- Tagged commits matching `v*` or manual workflow dispatch.

### Steps
1. **Checkout** the code.
2. **Set up environment** identical to CI.
3. **Build artifacts** (e.g., Python wheels, Docker images).
4. **Publish** artifacts to package registries or container registries.
5. **Create GitHub Release** with changelog and uploaded artifacts.

## Linting
- Run as part of CI using `pre-commit`, `flake8`, or other relevant tools.
- Fail the workflow if linting issues are found.

## Testing
- Tests should run in a clean environment and report coverage.
- Consider parallelizing tests to speed up execution.

## Example Workflow Skeleton
```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.x"
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: flake8 .
      - run: pytest --cov
```
