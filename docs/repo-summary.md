# Repository Summary

LiOr is a minimal open-source project that primarily consists of documentation on advertising analysis, marketing methods, profit strategies, and development framework research. The README provides brief setup instructions for a Node.js environment, while the `src` and `tests` directories contain placeholder folders for future code. This repository serves as a starting point for experimentation and can be extended with new features or scripts.
