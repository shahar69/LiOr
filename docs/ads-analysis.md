# Advertising Platforms ROI Analysis for Sustainable Fashion Brand

This document summarizes research on popular advertising channels suitable for a small **sustainable fashion** brand. It covers typical costs, audience targeting options, and examples of successful campaigns.

## 1. Social Media Ads

### Facebook & Instagram
* **Costs**: Typical cost-per-click (CPC) ranges $0.50–$2.00 for fashion-related ads. CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions) often falls between $5–$12. Budgets can start low, making it accessible for small brands.
* **Targeting**: Demographics (age, gender), interests ("sustainable fashion", "eco-friendly lifestyle"), behaviors, and lookalike audiences.
* **Examples**: Many sustainable clothing brands run Instagram Stories ads showing short videos of eco-friendly products. Carousel ads on Facebook highlight different outfits and promote limited-time discounts.

### TikTok Ads
* **Costs**: CPC commonly ranges $0.20–$1.00. CPM for in-feed ads may be $1–$4 but can vary. Minimum campaign budgets are fairly low.
* **Targeting**: Age groups (e.g., 18–35), interests such as "ethical fashion" or "climate activism", plus custom audience retargeting from website visitors.
* **Examples**: Short user-generated style videos with trending audio have driven viral engagement for sustainable clothing lines, boosting site traffic and sales.

## 2. Search Ads

### Google Ads (Search Network)
* **Costs**: Fashion keywords can see $1–$3 CPC. Niche terms like "organic cotton t-shirts" tend to be on the lower end. Bidding strategies (e.g., Target CPA) can optimize spend.
* **Targeting**: Keyword targeting with match types, negative keywords, location targeting, and device adjustments. Remarketing lists for search ads (RLSA) can target previous website visitors.
* **Examples**: Small boutiques often bid on long-tail queries such as "buy sustainable leggings" and run ad copy emphasizing eco-friendly materials. Pairing search ads with shopping campaigns increases ROI.

### Microsoft Advertising (Bing)
* **Costs**: Generally 20–30% lower CPC than Google due to less competition. Useful for reaching older demographics with disposable income.
* **Targeting**: Similar keyword targeting as Google, plus LinkedIn profile targeting for professional demographics.
* **Examples**: Ethical apparel brands have seen strong return by combining Bing search ads with remarketing banners, capturing users across multiple devices.

## 3. Display & Native Ads

### Google Display Network (GDN)
* **Costs**: CPC often $0.50–$1.00; CPM around $2–$5 depending on placements. Allows flexible daily budgets.
* **Targeting**: Affinity audiences ("green living"), custom intent audiences, website remarketing, and placement targeting on relevant blogs.
* **Examples**: Banner ads featuring eco-friendly messaging on blogs about sustainability attract high click-through rates. Dynamic remarketing displays items shoppers viewed but didn’t purchase.

### Taboola & Outbrain (Native Ads)
* **Costs**: Typically $0.40–$1.00 CPC. High-volume campaigns may negotiate CPM deals.
* **Targeting**: Contextual targeting on lifestyle, news, and fashion sites. Interest-based segments for "environmentalism" or "fashion." Retargeting is also available.
* **Examples**: Long-form sponsored articles about slow fashion trends generate traffic from high-authority publications, building brand credibility and conversions.

## 4. Influencer & Affiliate Platforms

* **Costs**: Influencer rates vary widely. Micro-influencers may charge $100–$500 per sponsored post, while larger creators charge more. Affiliate programs typically pay 5–15% of each sale.
* **Targeting**: Collaborations with influencers focusing on sustainability attract followers who care about eco-conscious purchases.
* **Examples**: Giveaways or discount codes shared by fashion bloggers often yield strong ROI by driving direct purchases and user-generated content.
