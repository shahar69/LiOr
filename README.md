=======

LiOr is an open-source platform designed to showcase simple development workflows. The project aims to provide a lightweight starting point that you can clone, extend, and run locally with minimal setup.

## Overview

At its core, LiOr serves as a minimal example application intended for experimentation in the Codex environment. Although the repository currently contains only this documentation, future revisions will expand it into a small runnable project.
