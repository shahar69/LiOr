# LiOr
This project is licensed under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
=======

LiOr is an open-source platform designed to showcase simple development workflows. The project aims to provide a lightweight starting point that you can clone, extend, and run locally with minimal setup.

## Overview

At its core, LiOr serves as a minimal example application intended for experimentation in the Codex environment. Although the repository currently contains only this documentation, future revisions will expand it into a small runnable project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the following software is installed before proceeding:

- **Git** – used to clone the repository.
- **Node.js (version 14 or higher)** – required to run the example application.
- **npm** – comes packaged with Node.js and is used to manage dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd LiOr
   ```

2. Install the dependencies (once a `package.json` file is available):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If no `package.json` is present yet, you can skip this step.

## Usage

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This command launches a server—usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000`—which will display a placeholder page until more functionality is added.

## Inventory CLI

The repository includes `src/store_manager.py`, a simple command-line tool that stores product data in a JSON file. Use it to experiment with basic automation workflows:

```bash
# Add products from products.json to store.json
python src/store_manager.py store.json --add products.json
```

The file `docs/automatic-store-tasks.md` outlines a roadmap for expanding this into a more robust automation platform.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and open a pull request to add features or improve the documentation.
